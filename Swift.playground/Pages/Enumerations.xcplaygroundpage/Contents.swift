 Enumerations are the common type of a group of related values and enables you to work with those values in a type-safe way within your code. - A definition from Apple's Swift programming book.

/*:
 Enumerartions can come prepopulated. Those can be considered default values for the enum. All values should be of same type. It's an alternative approach to assocaited values.
 
 Raw values are not the same as associated values. Raw values are set to prepopulated values when you first define the enumeration in your code, like the three ASCII codes above. The raw value for a particular enumeration case is always the same. Associated values are set when you create a new constant or variable based on one of the enumerationâ€™s cases, and can be different each time you do so.
